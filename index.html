    <h1>Anyone Roleplaying Games</h1>
</h2>A roleplaying game community in Crown Heights, Brooklyn</h2>

<p>AnyoneRPG exists to provide a welcoming, inclusive and supportive
  environment where longtime players and first-time players can share
  the joy of roleplaying games together. We work to support an
  environment where all players can participate, regardless of
  experience, where players learn through play, where we play
  roleplaying games in a way that is fun, inventive, collaborative,
  surprising and, at times, deeply moving.</p>

<p>We host two one-shot games a month, Dungeons & Dragons on the 2nd
  Sunday of every month, and an independent roleplaying game on last
  Sunday of every month. We also host a number of short ongoing
  games on weeknights, that generally last between 6 and 10
  sessions. All of our games are open to all; many active members of
  our community played their first roleplaying game with us. You do
  not need to own any books, supplies or dice.</p>

<p>Please read our <a href='conduct.html>code of conduct</a>.</p>
